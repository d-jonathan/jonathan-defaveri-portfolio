    <p>I'm a <strong>user experience designer and web developer</strong> who enjoys helping people to use new capabilities and technologies to tackle complex analytic problems. Currently I help to advise and facilitate working with technology teams to make enterprise software more user-friendly for analysts.</p>
    <p>Originally from outside of Atlanta, Georgia, I  have a weakness for things that come deep fried. I'm also a caffeine addict and can usually be bribed with a good cup of coffee.</p>
